# RL-Agent-for-Taxi-v3-Environment

RL Taxi is a reinforcement learning project where I taught a virtual taxi how to pick up and drop off passengers in a grid-like world called Taxi-v3 from OpenAI Gym. The goal was to let the taxi figure things out on its ownâ€”basically, it learns by trial and error, making mistakes, and getting rewards when it does the right thing.

Over time, the taxi gets smarter by exploring different moves and remembering what works best. This project demonstrates how an AI agent can learn policies in a discrete environment using value-based methods.
